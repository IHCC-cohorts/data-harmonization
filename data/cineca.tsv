Summary:	This is a first pass of gathering and structuring key data to be used to build the WP3 minimal metadata model.											
Content:	The chosen sub-categories are shaped by common data categories collected by major catalogues such as Maelstrom. The chosen variables are either CINECA use case requirements, or variables that can be mapped to by the majority of CINECA cohorts, or typical metadata variables collected by major catalogues. We have applied ontology terms to variables (mostly from NCIT). We are also looking into cross referencing with existing minimal data models. 											
Possible next steps: 	Create application ontology and structure terms in a hierarchy for easier search. For each variable, specify values and associated ontology terms (eg. for gender - specify male/female/transgender/non-binary).
