GE:0000406	Episode order	Episodes and spells; Period of care	This field contains the number of the episode within the current spell. All spells start with an episode where epiorder is 01. Many spells finish with this episode, but if the patient moves to the care of another consultant, a new episode begins. Episode numbers increase by 1 for each new episode until the patient is discharged (this includes transfers to another NHS trust or primary care trust - ie the first episode in the new trust will have epiorder 01). If the same patient returns for a different spell in hospital, epiorder is again set to 01. Admissions are calculated by counting the number of times epiorder is 01. When studying long term care, remember that it is not unusual to transfer psychiatric patients from one hospital to another.	survey administration	epiorder		transfer to care of another consultant increases number of episode (1,2,3,4...)
GE:0000407	Episode status	Episodes and spells; Period of care	This field tells you whether the episode had finished before the end of the HES data-year (ie whether the episode was still 'live' at midnight on 31 March). For example, if a patient was admitted on 25 March 2005 and was not discharged (or transferred to the care of another consultant) until 4 April 2005, there will be a record describing the unfinished episode (episode status = 1) in the 2004-05 data, and a separate record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data. Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses. Also, if unfinished episodes are included in time series analyses - where data for more than one year is involved - there is a danger of counting the same episode twice.	date and time-related information	epistat		was episode still occurring on Mar 31 (end of year)? date or timeline?

It is derived from epistart (episode start date) and epiend (episode end date). For episodes that both start and finish in the data year, bedyear has the same value as epidur (episode duration). If the episode is unfinished, bedyear is calculated from epistart and the end of the data year. If epistart is before the beginning of the data year, bedyear is calculated from the start of the data year and epiend. If the record type is other maternity events (episode type 5 or 6), bedyear is null.	survey administration	bedyear

GE:0000834	IMD Index of Multiple Deprivation	Socio-economic|Geographical	"The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a measure of multiple deprivation at Super Output Area level. The IMD has seven domains. The English Indices of Deprivation provide a relative measure of deprivation at small area level across England. Areas are ranked from least deprived to most deprived on seven different dimensions of deprivation and an overall composite measure of multiple deprivation. The domains used in the Indices of Deprivation are: income deprivation; employment deprivation; health deprivation and disability; education deprivation; crime deprivation; barriers to housing and services deprivation; and living environment deprivation. Each of these domains has its own scores and ranks, allowing users to focus on specific aspects of deprivation. In addition, two supplementary indices measure income deprivation amongst children - the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) - and older people - the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI).
 
 
 
 The current HES version of the Index is 2010, although the current IMD version of the index is 2015 which can be found on the IMD website:
