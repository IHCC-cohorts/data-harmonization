GE:opertn_01	Operative procedure	Clinical	There are twenty-four fields (twelve before April 2007), oper_01 to oper_24, which contain information about a patient's operations. The field oper_01 contains the main (ie most resource intensive) procedure. The other fields contain secondary procedures. The codes are defined in the Tabular List of the Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures. The current version is OPCS4. Procedure codes start with a letter and are followed by two or three digits. The third digit identifies variations on a main procedure code containing two digits. The third digit is preceded by a full stop in OPCS4, but this is not stored in the field. A single operation may contain more than one procedure.	surgical interventions

GE:disdest	Destination on discharge	Discharges; Period of Care	This field contains a code which identifies where the patient was due to go on leaving hospital. In most cases they return home. For many patients discharge destination is the same as source of admission (admisorc).	location			
GE:dismeth	Method of discharge	Discharges; Period of Care	This field contains a code which defines the circumstances under which a patient left hospital. For the majority of patients this is when they are discharged by the consultant. This field is only completed for the last episode in a spell.	survey administration

GE:episodes_and_spells_period_of_care	Episodes and spells; Period of care			survey administration			
GE:epiorder	Episode order	Episodes and spells; Period of care	This field contains the number of the episode within the current spell. All spells start with an episode where epiorder is 01. Many spells finish with this episode, but if the patient moves to the care of another consultant, a new episode begins. Episode numbers increase by 1 for each new episode until the patient is discharged (this includes transfers to another NHS trust or primary care trust - ie the first episode in the new trust will have epiorder 01). If the same patient returns for a different spell in hospital, epiorder is again set to 01. Admissions are calculated by counting the number of times epiorder is 01. When studying long term care, remember that it is not unusual to transfer psychiatric patients from one hospital to another.	survey administration		transfer to care of another consultant increases number of episode (1,2,3,4...)	
GE:epistat	Episode status	Episodes and spells; Period of care	This field tells you whether the episode had finished before the end of the HES data-year (ie whether the episode was still 'live' at midnight on 31 March). For example, if a patient was admitted on 25 March 2005 and was not discharged (or transferred to the care of another consultant) until 4 April 2005, there will be a record describing the unfinished episode (episode status = 1) in the 2004-05 data, and a separate record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data. Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses. Also, if unfinished episodes are included in time series analyses - where data for more than one year is involved - there is a danger of counting the same episode twice.	date and time-related information		was episode still occurring on Mar 31 (end of year)? date or timeline?

GE:bedyear	Bed days within the year	Episodes and spells; Period of care	This derived field provides the duration of an episode in days within the HES data year. It is derived from epistart (episode start date) and epiend (episode end date). For episodes that both start and finish in the data year, bedyear has the same value as epidur (episode duration). If the episode is unfinished, bedyear is calculated from epistart and the end of the data year. If epistart is before the beginning of the data year, bedyear is calculated from the start of the data year and epiend. If the record type is other maternity events (episode type 5 or 6), bedyear is null.	survey administration

 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ the appointment accepted date (or the invitation offer date sent of the first appointment offer where the appointment offer is sent) for the first appointment following the patient not attending an appointment or elective admission. See referral to treatment period and Discharge After Patient Did Not Attend for guidance on patients who do not attend
 
 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ The appointment date of the appointment that the Patient did not attend should be used where it is not possible to identify the appointment accepted date or the invitation offer date sent. The Referral to Treatment Period Status is 'National Code 10 - first activity'
 
 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢Following active monitoring:
 
 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ the activity date of a care activity when a decision to treat was made following Active Monitoring and the Referral to Treatment Period Status is 'National Code 11 - active monitoring end'
 
 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ This will include a decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that Patient's agreed care plan.
 
 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢On identifying a separate condition:
 
 ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ the referral request received date of a service request when a decision has been made to refer the Patient directly to a Consultant Led Service or an NHS Allied Health Professional Service (Referral To Treatment Measurement) for a separate condition (the Referral to Treatment Period status for the first care activity with the new consultant or NHS Allied Health Professional Service (Referral To Treatment Measurement) is 'National Code 12 - consultant or NHS Allied Health Professional Service (Referral To Treatment) referral'). 
 
 Referral to Treatment Consultant Led Waiting Times:
 
 For most Patients, the start of the Referral to Treatment Period begins with a service request from a General Medical Practitioner to a Consultant.
 
 Service requests to consultants who provide care services in community settings also start referral to treatment periods and the referral request received date will be the start of the referral to treatment period.
 
 A referral to treatment period may also start from service requests to consultants from general dental practitioners, Practitioners with Special Interests, optometrists and Orthoptists, National Screening Programmes, specialist nurses, other care professionals where commissioning Organisations have approved these mechanisms locally.
 
 An 18-week clock also starts upon a self-referral by a Patient to the above services, where these pathways have been agreed locally by commissioners and providers and once the referral is ratified by a care professional.
 
 A Referral to Treatment Period will also start where Patients are transferred to an elective Consultant Led Service through service requests from Accident and Emergency Departments including Minor injuries units and Walk In Centres."	date and time-related information

GE:imd04	IMD Index of Multiple Deprivation	Socio-economic|Geographical	"The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a measure of multiple deprivation at Super Output Area level. The IMD has seven domains. The English Indices of Deprivation provide a relative measure of deprivation at small area level across England. Areas are ranked from least deprived to most deprived on seven different dimensions of deprivation and an overall composite measure of multiple deprivation. The domains used in the Indices of Deprivation are: income deprivation; employment deprivation; health deprivation and disability; education deprivation; crime deprivation; barriers to housing and services deprivation; and living environment deprivation. Each of these domains has its own scores and ranks, allowing users to focus on specific aspects of deprivation. In addition, two supplementary indices measure income deprivation amongst children - the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) - and older people - the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI).
 
 
 
 The current HES version of the Index is 2010, although the current IMD version of the index is 2015 which can be found on the IMD website:
