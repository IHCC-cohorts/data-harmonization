GE:admistat	Psychiatric history on admission		This field contains a code which identifies previous psychiatric care for psychiatric patients. It applies only to patients admitted or transferred to a consultant in one of the psychiatric specialties during a spell in hospital. It is recorded for the first such consultant episode but not for subsequent psychiatric consultant episodes or any non-psychiatric episodes. This field is used to indicate the turnover for psychiatric patients, and identify first time psychiatric admissions and re-admissions. Where a patient has a history of admission to several hospital providers, priority is given to the current hospital provider (code 1), regardless of whether the preceding admission was to the same hospital provider. This field replaces special (UK NHS specific) diagnosis codes commencing U69 (1 April 1989 to 31 March 1995) and U51 (1 April 1995 to 31 march 1996), and also the HES derived V code indicator data item.

Episode numbers increase by 1 for each new episode until the patient is discharged (this includes transfers to another NHS trust or primary care trust - ie the first episode in the new trust will have epiorder 01). If the same patient returns for a different spell in hospital, epiorder is again set to 01. Admissions are calculated by counting the number of times epiorder is 01.

GE:epistat	Episode status		This field tells you whether the episode had finished before the end of the HES data-year (ie whether the episode was still 'live' at midnight on 31 March). For example, if a patient was admitted on 25 March 2005 and was not discharged (or transferred to the care of another consultant) until 4 April 2005, there will be a record describing the unfinished episode (episode status = 1) in the 2004-05 data, and a separate record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data. Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses. Also, if unfinished episodes are included in time series analyses - where data for more than one year is involved - there is a danger of counting the same episode twice.

GE:imd04	IMD Index of Multiple Deprivation		"The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a measure of multiple deprivation at Super Output Area level. The IMD has seven domains. The English Indices of Deprivation provide a relative measure of deprivation at small area level across England. Areas are ranked from least deprived to most deprived on seven different dimensions of deprivation and an overall composite measure of multiple deprivation. The domains used in the Indices of Deprivation are: income deprivation; employment deprivation; health deprivation and disability; education deprivation; crime deprivation; barriers to housing and services deprivation; and living environment deprivation. Each of these domains has its own scores and ranks, allowing users to focus on specific aspects of deprivation. In addition, two supplementary indices measure income deprivation amongst children - the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) - and older people - the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI).

GE:opertn_01	Operative procedure		There are twenty-four fields (twelve before April 2007), oper_01 to oper_24, which contain information about a patient's operations. The field oper_01 contains the main (ie most resource intensive) procedure. The other fields contain secondary procedures. The codes are defined in the Tabular List of the Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures. The current version is OPCS4. Procedure codes start with a letter and are followed by two or three digits. The third digit identifies variations on a main procedure code containing two digits. The third digit is preceded by a full stop in OPCS4, but this is not stored in the field. A single operation may contain more than one procedure.	Clinical	"4an = Procedure code

GE:vind	V code indicator		This derived field contains a code that indicates whether any of the diagnosis fields (diag_01 to diag_07) contains a valid V code (see diag_nn). For 1995-1996 only, U codes replaced the V codes. Although classed as Psychiatric data, values 1 to 3 indicate the level of neonatal care for a patient aged under 29 days.	Psychiatric	"From 1989-90: 
 
 1 = V290 - Neonate: normal care usually given by a mother in a maternity neonatal ward, supervised by a midwife and doctor but requiring minimal medical or nursing advice 
 
 2 = V291 - Neonate: special care which provided observation and treatment falling short of intensive care but exceeding routine care 
 
 3 = V292 - Neonate: intensive care which involved continuous skills supervision by nursing and medical staff for at least one hour or until death. Resuscitation carried out immediately after birth and completed within an hour or so does not constitute intensive care 
 
 4 = V690 - Psychiatric: not previously known to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital or hospital unit 
 
 5 = V691 - Psychiatric: previously admitted to a psychiatric hospital or hospital unit of the provider 
 
 6 = V692 - Psychiatric: previously admitted to a psychiatric hospital or a hospital unit of another provider 
 
 
 
 For the 1995-96 year only, the codes were changed to the following (see above for definitions): 
 
 V290 became U500 
 
 V291 became U501 
 
 V292 became U502 or U503 (U502 denoting a level of care higher than that previously denoted by V291 but falling short of the highest, for which U503 was used) 
 
 V690 became U510 
 
 V691 became U511

 04 = Planned local surgical admission. A pre-arranged surgical admission from the local area to the unit, acceptance by unit must have occurred prior to the start of the surgical procedure and the procedure will usually have been of an elective or scheduled nature.
